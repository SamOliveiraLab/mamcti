# Microscope Stage Automation for Multiple-location Chamber Time-lapse Imaging

This repository, `mamcti`, contains the codes needed to automate the movement of the microscope stage with respect to a matrix of the chamber positions in a microfluidic chip. It is automated to capture a multi-channel time-lapse experiment. It corrects the errors in alignment using a chamber detection algorithm real-time. It also interfaces with `Kyra's project name` to conduct on the flu image analysis.
